# These Streets
These Streets is dedicated to one main goal, getting people out into the real world and connecting with the places and people around them. By using technology and innovation, we build apps and services that create personalized spatial experiences such as self-guided tours, geolocated social media, and other experiences meant to bridge the gap between the digital and real worlds.
